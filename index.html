        <h2>Plants Classification Based on Growth Habits:</h2>
        <p>We see a huge variety of plants all around us. Among which few are terrestrial and aquatic plants. Despite this fact, they all have the same parts and the same functions; they appear unique with different types of roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds etc. Therefore, the classification of plants is mainly based on several factors, and they can be further classified based on their height, tenderness of stem, branches and their life cycle.</p>
       <section>
        <h3><i>What is a <em class = "special">Growth Habit?</em></i></h3>
        <p>
            In horticulture, the term growth habits refer to the plant’s growth and its development or change in the plant’s height, shape and the kind of growth it undergoes. There are genetic factors as well as environmental factors which play an important role in their growth habit.
<br><br>
For instance, interaction with various animals influences the way plants adapt to their environment. From an evolutionary perspective, growth habits have the function of ensuring the survival and adaptation of plants in various habitats, consequently increasing the chances of successfully passing on the genes to the next generation.

            One of the important categories of classification, plants can also be differentiated in terms of their size. From small, medium to huge, the growth of a plant remains limited to the size it corresponds. Take a look at their different types as per the category of size.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <em class = "special">Herbs</em> are considered the smallest in size. Their heights are not more than a foot or a few centimetres and consist of soft stems. Generally, they have fewer branches or none. These herbs are filled with vitamins and minerals and are an essential part of a nutritious diet. Some of the major examples of herbs are tomato, ginger, paddy, etc

        <br>
        <p>
            ‘They are also not very big in size but they are bigger than the herbs, almost a meter and have hard stems. Examples of shrubs are Rosemary, Cherry, Basil, etc.
        <br>
        As we all know,<em class = "special">trees</em> are the biggest of plants and have very hard stems which are known as the trunk. The trunk of a tree has branches that bear fruits, leaves and fruits. They can have great heights, mostly more than a meter. Examples of trees are Mango, Banana, etc.

            Did you know: The very expensive spice, saffron, comes from a type of crocus flower
            </span>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Those plants that creep on the ground have very fragile as well as thin and long stems are referred to as <em class = "special">creepers</em>. These creepers cannot stand straight or support their own weight. Some of the major creepers include strawberries, sweet potatoes, watermelon, amongst others.
        <br>
        Similar to creepers in their thin, long and weak stems, the <em class = "special">Climbers</em> cannot stand erect as well but grow vertically through external supports and can carry their own weight. Some of the examples of climbers are money plants, runner beans, grapevine, etc.
