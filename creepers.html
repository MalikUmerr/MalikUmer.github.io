        Creepers, as the name suggests, are plants that creep on the ground. They have very fragile, long, thin stems that can neither stand erect nor support all their weight. Examples include watermelon, strawberry, pumpkin and sweet potatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the fastest-growing creeping plants include creeping Jenny, evening primrose, periwinkle, wintercreeper, English ivy, sweet woodruff, blue star creeper, and bugleweed. It’s important to check whether you have any local restrictions against planting these creepers, as they are considered invasive in some areas due to their prolific growth.

    <p>
        In cases where the vines are long enough, you can train creepers to grow up a support structure by attaching the stems to the structure with twine or another material. In this sense, creepers differ from "climbers," which are vines that tend to attach to structures on their own. Some plants with "creeper" in their name are vigorous climbers, including Virginia creeper and Canary creeper.

         <h3><i><u>Uses</u></i></h3>
    <p>The most general use for a creeping plant is as a ground cover. Those that bloom heavily not only serve practical purposes (erosion control, weed suppression) but also add great beauty to the landscape. Creeping phlox, in particular, can furnish dynamic color displays. Many gardeners love the look of it cascading down a slope when blooming in the spring.
